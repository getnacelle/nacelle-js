feat: adds `getConfig` and `setConfig` functions

- `getConfig` allows for reviewing options set in the cart client such as the `language`, `country`, the Shopify Shop Id, and other options.
- `setConfig` allows for updating some of the configuration options used to make requests to Shopify - namely `language` and `country` at this juncture.
