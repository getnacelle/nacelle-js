## Getting Started

Nacelle-js is set of tools designed to empower developers to build unique, performant & scalable storefronts. The repository is broken the following parts.

### Packages

The `packages/` directory contains all of the project's installable npm packages. These packages should be modular and exclude all non-critical dependencies.

### Starters

The `starters/` directory contains all of the project's framework-specific starters. These starters should be minimal and should not impose any unnecessary coding conventions.

### Examples

The `examples/` directory contains all of the project's example implementations such as integrating 3rd party apps. These examples should contain the least amount of code required to function.

## Making Contributions

Nacelle-js contributions are key to the success of the project. There are a number of ways you can contribute.

### Reporting Bugs

We use [Github Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) to track all reported bugs. Before submitting a bug we ask that you review our pre-bug [checklist](#before-submitting-a-bug).

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

- **Reproduce the bug**. To eliminate any outside factors you should create an isolated code sandbox confirming the bug. The sandbox should include the minimal amount of code to reproduce the bug.

- **Check the discussions**. Once you've confirmed that you can reproduce the bug, you should check the [discussion board](https://github.com/getnacelle/nacelle-js/discussions) to see if there are any other recommended resolutions.

- **Perform a search**. Once you've checked that a solution does not exists in the discussion board, you can should check to make sure the bug has not been filed already. To do so perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/search?q=+is%3Aissue+user%3AgetNacelle) on all existing issues.

#### How To Submit A Good Bug Report

When you've determined that the bug you're experiencing should be reported fill out the [Bug Report Template](BUG_REPORT.md).

The following details are required so our maintainers can quickly identify and reproduce the bug.

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.

- **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.

- **Provide a minimal reproduction of bug** in an minimal & isolated code sandbox.

- **Describe the actual behavior** that prompted you to report the bug.
