# nacelle-js

Nacelle is a managed backend service that acts as the connective tissue for your headless stack. Our infrastructure is built on an event-driven elastic core that Nacelle fully manages, so you don't have to worry about scaling, updates, and general DevOps. We focus on fighting headless headaches like eventual consistency, backend maintenance, and interoperability so you can build the things that matter to your brand without getting bogged down.

Our Ingestion Engine pulls data from your commerce systems. After indexing this data, you can leverage the Federated GraphQL, JavaScript SDK, or React/Vue starter kits to craft a compelling shopping experience for your customers.
