# Nacelle

Nacelle is a managed backend service that acts as the connective tissue for headless commerce. Our infrastructure is built on an event-driven elastic core that Nacelle fully manages, so you don't have to worry about scaling, updates, and general DevOps. We focus on fighting headless headaches like eventual consistency, backend maintenance, and interoperability so you can build the things that matter to your brand without getting bogged down.

This repository contains packages and examples you can use to build your storefront.
